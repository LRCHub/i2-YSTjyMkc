[00:11.55] I left my street
[00:14.43] I'm a guillotine
[00:17.47] Pullin' away
[00:19.59] In my machine
[00:26.09] 
[00:22.51] Where have I been now?
[00:25.45] Not you
[00:31.00] Shootin' stars in my left arm
[00:34.27] It's an alcohol low
[00:43.77] 
[00:36.47] Givin' away time to casio
[00:41.27] Sun is slow
[00:46.77] 
[00:43.37] An' I got soul
[00:48.14] Is this where I'm going to?
[00:52.41] We'll see
[00:57.84] We'll see
[01:02.34] 
[01:00.80] We'll see
[01:02.92] I kill this sleep
[01:04.84] I'm a man in the moon
[01:15.34] 
[01:07.74] Walkin' on sand on my own high noon
[01:12.54] Love with the moon
[01:15.22] I love you
[01:21.37] 'Cause I left my street
[01:24.08] I'm a guillotine
[01:26.97] Pull it away
[01:29.70] In my machine
[01:32.07] Forget where I've been before
[01:34.75] Forget you
[01:38.78] Is this where I'm going to?
[01:42.74] We'll see
[01:48.93] We'll see
[01:51.63] We'll see
