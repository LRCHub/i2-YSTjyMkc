Mix it up

Jane Morello keeps it mellow
An Amaretto, an Amaretto
Mike Morello keeps it mellow
A vodka jello, a vodka jello
Jane Morello keeps it mellow
An Amaretto, an Amaretto
Mike Morello keeps it mellow
A vodka jello, a vodka jello

Jumpin' up, takin' me
On a trip to Tenerife
Keepin' it holiday
On a beach, you wanna stay
Jane Morello, Mike Morello
Keeps it mellow, keeps it mellow
Amaretto, vodka jello
All night, all night

Selling it on a drip
Keeps it mellow 'til it slips
Doesn't want anyone
To tell her that she's on the run
Keepin' it real, there's a spill
And I'm gonna get it from the spigot
High, low, any way
That's the drop that I would save

Jumpin' up, takin' me
On a trip to Tenerife
Keepin' it holiday
On a beach, you wanna stay
Jane Morello, Mike Morello
Keeps it mellow, keeps it mellow
Amaretto, vodka jello
All night, all night

Mix it up (Drip, drip)
Mix it up
Mix it up (Drip, drip)
Mix it up (More, more)

I'm really good, are you keepin' up?
I'd let you rest, but I play too much
Come on, tap me out, or did you come for more?
I might give a little better than I did before
Too much for some, but I'm never done
I'm down too much, I need my fun
Pour me out 'cause I drip real smooth
Can't scoop me up 'til I'm done with you
Follow me, know Shy knows best
Oi, Jane, who is she? Lose your mind, don't be stressed
Amaretto on your lips as it drips down my chest
(As it drips down my chest)
Too much for some, but I'm never done
I'm down too much, I need my fun
Pour me out 'cause I drip real smooth
Pour me out til I'm done with you

Mix it up (Drip, drip, drip more)
Mix it up (I just pour)
Mix it up (Drip, drip, drip more)
Mix it up (I just pour)

Jane Morello keeps it mellow
An Amaretto, an Amaretto
Mike Morello keeps it mellow (Drip, drip, drip)
A vodka jello, a vodka jello (Drip more, more)
Jane Morello keeps it mellow
An Amaretto, an Amaretto
Mike Morello keeps it mellow (Drip, drip, drip)
A vodka jello, a vodka jello (Drip more, more)

Jumpin' up, takin' me
On a trip to Tenerife
Keepin' it holiday
On a beach, you wanna stay
Jane Morello, Mike Morello
Keeps it mellow, keeps it mellow
Amaretto, vodka jello
All night, all night
