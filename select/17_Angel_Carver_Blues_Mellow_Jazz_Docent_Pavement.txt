When they fall in
They fall in from the roof
They grab on to me tightly
As if i knew the way
When i fight for something
I fight because i care
When i fight with you
I fight but i don't care
Everybody wants the questions to be asked
The questions are the answers
To questions in themselves
Ask me if i really need it
Ask me if you want to get hit
Hit it
Ask me if you want to be... fucked.
